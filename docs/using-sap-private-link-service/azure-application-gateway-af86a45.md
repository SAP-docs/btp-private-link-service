</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*subResource* \(required\)



</td>
<td valign="top">

Identifies the subresource on Azure the private link should be created for. This has to be the user-defined name of the <code><i>Frontend IP Configuration</i></code> of the <code><i>Private link configuration</i></code> the connection should be created for.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*requestMessage* \(optional\)

## Transport Layer Security

Since the Azure Application Gateway doesn't provide its own PrivateLink DNS entries, the SAP Private Link service creates DNS names that can be used for proper TLS just like it does for connections to Azure Private Link services.

Please refer to the [documentation of the Private Link service](https://github.tools.sap/C5338252/btp-private-link-service/blob/dc41b9cd6024b8300c94d32a6b9baa1eaee84e1b/docs/using-sap-private-link-service/azure-private-link-service-e8bc0c6.md) for details. Instead of configuring the certificate in the backend service, for Azure Application Gateway the certificate has to be configured in the HTTPS listener of the gateway itself.

## Known Limitations

-   Azure Application Gateway requires a `V2` SKU to work with PrivateLink. The `V1` SKUs do not work with PrivateLink.
