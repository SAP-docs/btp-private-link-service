## Further Information

> ### Note:  
> `Basic` version of MySQL is not supported since it does not allow Private Endpoints creation. All supported versions can be found in the official [Azure Database for MySQL documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/concepts-limits#vnet-service-endpoints).

## Sample Applications

There is no custom configuration needed to connect to the MySQL server via SAP Private Link.

Just use a MySQL client library of your choice and configure it to use the hostname from the service binding \(and of course, username, password and any other settings\).
